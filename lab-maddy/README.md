# Documentation:

### What this project does:
   The goal of this API is to practice using express, Mongo and mongoose. We'll also be using .populate, population is the process of automatically replacing the specified paths in the document with document(s) from other collection(s).

   * We will be able to create a 2 resource MongoDB and Express API
   * We will be able to reference additional resources as part of their mongoose.js based data models
   * We will be able to use the `populate` method to allow for resource query population

#### Feature Tasks
  * create an HTTP Server using `express`
  * create a resource **model** of my choice that uses `mongoose.Schema` and `mongoose.model`
  * use the `body-parser` express middleware to parse the `req` body on `POST` and `PUT` requests
  * use the npm `debug` module to log the functions and methods that are being used in my application
  * use the express `Router` to create a route for doing **RESTFUL CRUD** operations against your _model_

# How another dev could 'get started' with my api on their own:
  - How do you clone this project?
      1. First fork from my repository, then clone from your repo, then create a branch.
  - How do you start using this project?
      1. You will need to have NodeJS installed on your machine.
      2. You will need to install httpie in one terminal window.
      3. Then start up nodemon in a separate terminal window.


# Mongo database steps:

2. Have four windows open in terminal.
3. First window- 'mongod --dbpath ./data/db'

4. Second window- 'npm install mongodb' within the lab-maddy/data/db folder to start the mongo shell (to be able to see the database data)
  - should see:
    MongoDB shell version v3.4.7
    connecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
    MongoDB server version: 3.4.7
    Welcome to the MongoDB shell.
    For interactive help, type "help".

5. Third window- 'npm run start:watch' within the lab folder of the project(ie- lab-maddy) to get the server running and listening for changes
6. Back in second window- 'mongo'

7. In forth window within lab-maddy folder, use this one to ping your server and make http requestss-

'http POST :3000/api/toy name=gavin desc=human'

* If the name and desc are not strings, mongo will throw a 400 error.

should see:
```

    "desc": "human",
    "name": "gavin",
    "updatedAt": "2017-09-07T15:37:08.242Z"
}
```

8. Back in the second window- 'show dbs'
  - should see:
  admin    0.000GB
  local    0.000GB
  toy-dev  0.000GB

9. Then type- 'use toy-dev'
  - should see:
  switched to db toy-dev

10. Then type- 'show collections'
  - should see:
  toys

11. Then- 'db.toys.find()'. To make sure toys are being posted.
    Should see:
    ```
    { "_id" : ObjectId("59b167a41f2258fbdb489cc1"), "updatedAt" : ISODate("2017-09-07T15:37:08.242Z"), "createdAt" : ISODate("2017-09-07T15:37:08.242Z"), "name" : "gavin", "desc" : "human", "__v" : 0 }
    ```

    - 'db.toys.drop()' will drop those collections


# NOTES FOR MYSELF on 9/7:
- Tests that I have copied over from lab 13 to this lab are passing but I have not worked on them thoroughly at all!
- Michelle spent many hours working on tests for lab 9 and has been kind enough to share that knowledge with Isaiah and I. She has also welcomed us to look at her repo.
- Scott mentioned that some functionality we haven't completed is if we delete a child we need to delete all their toy objects. we would put this in child.js.

HOW TO TEST POST IN Mongo, using terminal:

  http POST :5000/api/child name=Michelle

HOW TO TEST GET with Mongo:

  http GET :5000/api/child/f18a6d2b-753c-41f6-9c28-d2a7f0b41f21

Should see:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

HOW TO TEST A PUT IN Mongo:


HOW TO TEST DELETE IN Mongo:


# Packages and commands to remember:
For Mongo:
- To install Mongo-- npm install mongodb into your project directory
- Start the MongoDB process-- mongod
- Start the MongoDB shell-- mongo

For Mongoose:
- To install mongoose-- $ npm install mongoose

General:
  - npm install dotenv

  - In package.json's scripts, add- "start:debug": "DEBUG=http* nodemon server.js",
  - created an index.js and set it as the start point in package.json
  - deleted parse-url.json and ________
  - added a cors.js file

  - npm install express - DONE
  - npm install (for node modules) -
  - npm install httpie -
  - npm install superagent -
  - npm install uuid -
  - npm install -D jest -
    - npm test

  - node server.js or just nodemon (depending on the day??)
    - rs (restart, if needed)
  - run start: watch -
  - npm run start:debug - then attempt a POST and this will tell you where you're wrong

  - npm run debugger -
  - npm install bluebird (sets this as a dependency in package.json) -

# Notes:
  - Using dotenv:
    - What is it?
    This module loads environment variables from a .env file that you create and adds them to the process.env object that is made available to the application.


  - Don't forget to git ignore your `db/` dir

  - I added the following to my package.json scripts:
  "debugger": "node inspect server.js",

  - I've added the server.js to the lib directory.

  - Then in terminal, within the project directory, type:
  npm run debugger
    - You should then see:
    > node inspect server.js

  - troubleshooting seeing ECONNREFUSED in terminal:
    - open another window and run 'mongod --dbpath ./data/db'

  - return Child.findById(req.params._id).populate('toy')_
